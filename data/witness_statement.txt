I was walking back from the grocery store around maybe 8:55 PM, not exactly sure, could have been 9 PM. The street lights on Elm Street flicker sometimes so visibility wasn’t perfect.

I remember hearing a loud crash — like metal hitting something. When I turned around, I saw a red sedan. I’m fairly certain it was red, though under the lights it might have looked slightly darker.

The car had damage to the front bumper. It wasn’t subtle. Something was hanging from the lower front area, maybe plastic trim.

The vehicle accelerated quickly after the crash. It turned left toward Maple Avenue.

I think there was only one person inside, but I couldn’t clearly see the driver’s face.

I didn’t see the license plate number. It all happened too fast.

The car looked like a mid-sized sedan, maybe a Toyota or Honda type. I’m not a car expert.

The crash happened near the corner of Elm Street and 5th Avenue.
